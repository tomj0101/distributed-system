# distributed-system
This Distributed system repository is the quick Onramp for people that want to understand how distributed-system, be prepared to hands-on and real-life Labs.

# Monolithic application
All-In-One, all modules are tightly coupled , you can't modify one without possibly affecting another.

# Monolithic Enterprise application
I called this one monolithic Enterprise, maybe is not the right name, but I see very commons in monilothic application for ingrease the Write and Read capacity, company decide todo add Cache Layer like Redis for speed the Reading, Queue System like Kafka for spead the writing, and Search engine database like Elasticsearch.

Hint:  Distributed System using Microservices you can just scale a particar services to increase the Read/Write capacity with just a simple ' scale --replicas=3 ', also Cache, Queue and Search Engine are used in big system, not always the solution is add it a new complexity layer! try to solve the problem firts from the best system design point of view, then choose the technology.

# Clarification #1
distributed-system â‰  high-performance computing(HPC): In some text books talk about this two terms like the same, but in this case let talk about like complete differents topics.

- distributed-system: Containers oriented, CI-CD Pipeline, quickly scale, support intensive load. we will used software like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Git, ELK and programming languages like Java11+, Python, Nodejs14+, ReactJS17+.

- HPC: Run big workloads for certains use case like Scienties, Usually running this on SuperComputer with special hardware with a lot CPU, RAM, GPU. we will use C, C++, OpenMP, OpenHPC, OpenMPI and Linux, also I will touch a topic the is not related to this. "High-Frecuency trading or HFT", this is not part of the HPC, HFT is more about speed and ulta-low latency, this topics will be with C++.

# Clarification #2 
The goals of this repo is have a Professional development setup ready, is not 101 Java, not 101 Spring Boot, not 101 Microservices, not 101 Kubernetes, not 101 ReactJS, not 101 C++, if you never take a training in this technology, I highly recomend go get the fudamentals knowlaged, do small project like todo-list and then return to this repo.
