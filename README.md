# distributed-system
This Distributed system repository is the quick Onramp for people that want to understand how distributed-system, be prepared to hands-on and real-life Labs.

# Clarification #1
distributed-system â‰  high-performance computing(HPC): In some text books talk about this two terms like the same, but in this case let talk about like complete differents topics.

- distributed-system: Containers oriented, CI-CD Pipeline, quickly scale, support intensive load. we will used software like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Git, ELK and programming languages like Java11+, Python, Nodejs14+, ReactJS17+.

- HPC: Run big workloads for certains use case like Scienties, Usually running this on SuperComputer with special hardware with a lot CPU, RAM, GPU. we will use C, C++, OpenMP, OpenHPC, OpenMPI and Linux, also I will touch a topic the is not related to this. "High-Frecuency trading or HFT", this is not part of the HPC, HFT is more about speed and ulta-low latency, this topics will be with C++.

# Clarification #2 
The goals of this repo is have a Professional development setup ready, is not 101 Java, not 101 Spring Boot, not 101 Microservices, not 101 Kubernetes, not 101 ReactJS, not 101 C++, if you never take a training in this technology, I highly recomend go get the fudamentals knowlaged, do small project like todo-list and then return to this repo.
